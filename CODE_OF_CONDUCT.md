# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy, accessible, and uncluttered IPA library. We aim to offer users a clean browsing experience free of ads, paywalls, or third-party links like Linkvertise. This code of conduct exists to foster a respectful and collaborative community that upholds these values.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces related to the project, including the website, repository, Discord server, and any Reddit posts or discussions about the project. It also applies when engaging with the community on social media or any other project-related channels.

## Expected Behavior
Community members and contributors are expected to:
- Be respectful and considerate to others.
- Provide and accept constructive feedback with a positive attitude.
- Avoid any form of racism, sexism, or discrimination.
- Use only light swearing, with the main goal of keeping the tone friendly and welcoming.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include:
- Harassment of any kind, including personal attacks or threats.
- Hating on or belittling others based on their opinions, background, or identity.
- Any form of discrimination (racism, sexism, etc.).
- Trolling that leads to someone being hurt or annoyed. Light-hearted, fun trolling is fine, as long as it keeps the environment welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.

## Reporting Issues
If someone experiences or witnesses behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, they can report it by pinging or directly messaging the project owner on the Discord server. Reports will be handled confidentially and with care.

## Consequences
Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in the following actions, depending on the severity of the behavior:
- **Warning:** A formal warning will be issued to address the behavior.
- **Mute:** Temporary suspension of the ability to participate in discussions.
- **Temporary Ban:** A temporary ban from the community or specific channels.
